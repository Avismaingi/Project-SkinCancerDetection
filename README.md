# Project-SkinCancerDetection
Skin Cancer Detection using Raspberry Pi and classify between Benign and Malignant. Increasing performance using Intel NCS2
Built a device that captures photos, which detect and classify the type ofskin cancer
in benign and malignant cases.
• Constructed a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) with 80%+ accuracy.
• Classification done by using using 8MP Camera(v2) ,RaspberryPi & NCS2.
• Team project with my role being optimization and conversion of model and
  configuring Ubuntu18, RaspbianOS to run model using NCS2.
• Technologies Used: INTEL® Movidius Neural Compute Stick 2, Raspberry Pi
  3b+,Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Panda, Linux, OpenVino, etc.
